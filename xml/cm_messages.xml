<string id="698">Auriuns: The Auriun people hail from the temperate western end of the Acaelian Empire. The Auriuns are an adventurous people with a love of technology that has made them amongst the best prospectors and shapers of earth around. Having been afforded the rich natural resources and lush environs that have long been the envy of neighboring countries, the Auriuns naturally became a well-rounded nation with similarly balanced denizens.&#10; The Auriuns have had a standing militia for as long as they&apos;ve been recording history. Their warriors revel in the ordered chaos of battle, streaming in by horse and hurling their steel javelins with deadly accuracy. They prefer a battlefield with lots of room to fight; close quarters simply aren&apos;t their style. Auriun warriors view their battles like a dance; an intricate set of steps flowing from one to the next. Only their dances tend to end up with a lot of their enemies off their feet. Or perhaps no longer possessing feet.</string>
<string id="699">Jorgrithian: The Jorgrithians are a hardened people from the north of Acaelia. It takes a strong person to survive the fearsome chill of a Jorgrith winter, and the Jorgrithians have proven time and again that they&apos;re nothing if not resilient. The north is thick with trees beyond the desires of even the greediest lumberjack and living in the verdant thickets and copses of the north has made the Jorgrithians quite the woodsmen indeed.&#10;When it comes to combat, Jorgrinthian warriors like it up close and personal, favoring massive two handed blades that have a tendency to rend limbs from their owners. Sharing a border with three other countries has left the Jorgrinthians no strangers to have a strong militia, through the legends of their battle prowess means they rarely encounter anyone foolish enough to make them use it.</string>
<string id="700">Khalis: Living in the brutal deserts of Khalis has left their people with a quick step and an unbreakable will. Hailing from the southeast of Acaelia, the Khalin deserts forced their people into a nomadic existence. Their ability to farm even the most of arid of land is legendary the continent over, with their people often having to set up and abandon a farm within the same year. Khalins are also known for being able to thrive in their barren environment, making use of what little natural resources that have been afforded them to carve out a powerful empire.&#10; In the heat of battle, most Khalins will be found charging around on horseback, trampling those foolish enough to stray underfoot. Whatever stragglers they don&apos;t stamp into the dirt, they expertly dice through with their blades. To duel a Khalin with a blade is likely an exercise in futility, though it&apos;s just as likely an exercise in getting yourself killed.</string>
